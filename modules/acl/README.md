# Description

This Terraform module is responsible for creating an Access Control List (ACL) within the VPC. The ACL is configured to manage inbound and outbound connectivity for the resources deployed within the VPC's subnets.
The ACL rules are defined to allow or deny traffic based on specified criteria. This includes controlling inbound traffic from external sources into the VPC and outbound traffic from resources within the VPC to external destinations.
